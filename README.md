## How to install
For the plugin to work properly, you have to make a few modifications in your theme. I've ported a WP theme so you can see what modifications you should make in your theme. If you want to have only sub-blogs, you don't have to add any modification. Modifications are needed for multilingual mode.

Download the plugin from here. Copy the "Penscratch" folder into your "bl-themes" folder and the "sub-blogs" folder into the "bl-plugins" folder.

Activate the plugin, enable it from settings and you are ready. You can enable or disable every mode you need.

During installation, the plugin will try to find your language and add it as "Default". You can change the default language, in case the system made a mistake, one time only. I'll add a mode to allow you to change the default language in future release.

The plugins doesn't touch any DB file of your blog. It creates its own folder under the db folder where it stores its own DB files. You can enable and disable the plugin without the fear of losing your posts.

You can disable the plugin from its settings, so you don't lose its settings if you disable it through the plugin manager.
